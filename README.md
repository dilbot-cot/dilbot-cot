# Hello, I'm Dillon Cotter! üëã

I take pride in designing and teaching about end-user no-code solutions to optimise common tasks, and designing both no/low code and coded Docusign integrations.

## Projects üìö
- **[Portfolio Website](https://dillonc.netlify.app/)**: My first project within three months of the coding bootcamp.
- **[Work From Home Tracker](https://github.com/dilbot-cot/work_from_home_project)**: A Python application that tracks work-from-home hours for tax purposes.

## Hobbies & Interests üåü
I have a passion for video games and amateur woodworking. These hobbies challenge my problem-solving skills and creativity, similar to how I approach my tech projects.

## Goals üéØ
**Short-term:** Enhance my understanding of API development with Docusign to improve my administrative and support roles.  
**Long-term:** Aim to take full ownership of the products I lead and potentially transition into a more tech-focused team as a developer.
